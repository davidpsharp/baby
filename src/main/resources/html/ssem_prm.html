<h1><font size="5">The Manchester University
<br>Small-Scale Experimental Machine
<br>Programmer's Reference Manual</font></h1>
<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>The Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM) is the "official" name for the 
prototype Manchester Mark 1 as it existed when it successfully executed the 
world's first stored computer program on 21st June 1948. After that date, the 
machine underwent significant expansion in both capacity and functionality, 
including the invention of innovations such as the "B"-tube (what we today call 
instruction-modifier, or index register). The designers of the machine had a 
policy of making it work stage by stage, rather than building the whole thing 
before attempting to make it work. This policy is what enabled them to get the 
machine working at such an early date. The Programmer's Reference given here is 
for that original minimal machine. There was no formal document at the time - 
the whole description was, and only needed to be, in the designers' notebooks. 
</p>
<p>I am grateful to Keith Wood and Andy Molyneux for providing some of the 
information and wording used in this Programmer's Reference document. </p>

<h2>2 Functional Description</h2>
<h3>2.1 The Store</h3>
<p>The Store holds 32 lines, each of 32 binary digits. The lines are numbered 
0-31, (from top to bottom when viewed on the monitor screen), and the digits are 
numbered 0-31 from left to right, with digit 0 being the least significant. Note 
this arrangement of binary significance, which was commonplace in the early 
development of serial computers as a consequence of the least significant digit 
appearing first (to make arithmetic carry circuits simpler) and the usage in 
engineering that time is often mapped on to a conventional X-axis. </p>
<p>The Store holds both instructions and data - what is often called "Von 
Neumann" architecture. </p>
<h3>2.2 The Accumulator</h3>
<p>The Accumulator has a single line of 32 digits, and holds the result of 
arithmetic operations.
<a name="M23">
<p></p>
<h3>2.3 The Control</h3></a>
<p>The Control normally holds a single line of 32 digits, known as the "Control 
Instruction", or "CI". The CI is similar to what we would today call the PC or 
Program Counter, and it contains the address (i.e. the line number) in the Store 
of an instruction. The CI is always incremented just prior to fetching an 
instruction for execution, so it typically holds the address of the instruction 
executed last, rather than to be executed next. Consequently, the instruction in 
line 1 will be the first to be executed when a program starts. </p>
<p>During the execution of an instruction, the Control transiently holds a 
second line known as the "Present Instruction" or "PI", containing the actual 
instruction fetched and being executed. While the machine is not executing 
instructions, the PI line does not exist. </p>
<h3>2.4 Number format</h3>
<p>Numbers are 32 bits long. The convention is that the most significant bit is 
a sign bit; negative numbers are held in complement form. There is no hardware 
to detect overflow or provide sign extension. Carries out of the top of a word 
are lost. </p>
<h3>2.5 Instruction format</h3>
<p>An instruction has two components: a "line number" and a "function number". 
The line number indicates the line of the store on which the instruction should 
operate, and the function number indicates the operation to be performed on that 
line. The "CMP" and "STOP" instructions do not use the line number, and ignore 
anything in that line of the store.. </p>
<p>One line in the store holds one instruction with the following layout: </p><pre>| Line No.  | Not Used | Func. No. | Not Used |
| 0 1 2 3 4 | 5 .. 12  | 13 14 15  | 16 .. 31 |
</pre>
<p>Only the eight defined bits are used in an instruction - the unused bits may 
be used for any purpose by the programmer and will be ignored by the instruction 
decoder. </p>
<h3>2.6 Instruction Set</h3>
<p>The function codes are tabulated below: </p><pre>Func.| Binary | IEE paper  | 'Modern' | Description
No.  | code(1)| mnemonic(2)| mnemonic |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
0	000	s,C	 	JMP	Copy content of Store line to CI
1	100	c+s,C	 	JRP	Add content of Store line to CI
2	010 	-s,A	 	LDN	Copy content of Store line,
					   negated, to accumulator.

</pre>
<ol>
  <li>Remember that in this machine, binary codes have the least significant 
  digit to the left. 
  <li>The "IEE paper mnemonic" is the way the instruction was named in 1948. 
  </li></ol>
<p>Some further details about instruction operation are given in <a href="#A1">Appendix 1</a>, and 
some programming hints in <a href="#A2">Appendix 2</a>. </p>
<h3>2.7 Instruction timings</h3>
<p>The SSEM is a serial computer, and the clock speed may be assumed to be 
100kc/s, i.e. 10 microseconds per digit. The digit period at 21st June 1948 was 
probably between 8.5 and 9.5 microseconds, but it was fixed at 10 microseconds 
later. </p>
<p>An instruction always takes four word times to execute, and each word is 32 
bits plus 4 bits in the gap between words. The time for an instruction therefore 
is 1.44mS, or a computer speed of about 700 instructions per second.
<a name="A1">
<h2>Appendix 1 - Programming details</h2></a>
<p></p>
<h3>A1.1 The <b>JMP</b> instruction</h3>
<p>The line number addresses a line in the store containing a line number to be 
transferred to CI, i.e. it is an indirect jump in modern terminology. Remember 
that the whole line is transferred to CI, and that CI is incremented just prior 
to starting a new instruction. For example: </p><pre>Line|Instr. |	Binary	     |  Comment
no. |or data|		     |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
...			
6    SUB 19  11001....001...   Accumulator op.,  subtract contents of line 19
7    CMP     00000....011...   Test sign of Accumulator
8    JMP 10  01010....000...   Jump back to instruction in line 6 if positive
9    STOP    00000....111...   Stop if negative
10   5	     10100....000...   CI for the JMP. <em>One less</em> than 
				   the destination line
...			
</pre>
<h2>A1.2 The <b>JRP</b> instruction</h2>
<p>The line number addresses a line in the Store containing a line number to be 
added to CI, i.e. an indirect relative jump. The whole contents of the addressed 
Store line is added to the CI and the result kept in CI. When the next 
instruction is started the CI is incremented, and the least significant 5 digits 
used as the address for fetching the instruction. [Note. This seems to be a 
"luxury" instruction to have in a minimal machine. The reason is that it is 
trivially easy to implement, and Tom Kilburn was looking towards the imminent 
increased storage capacity and use of relocatable code for use in subroutines.] 
</p>
<h2>A1.3 Manipulation of CI</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the CI is incremented before an instruction is fetched 
and executed. During program execution, if a CMP instruction finds that the 
Accumulator is negative, then a Test Flip Flop is set. If the Test Flip Flop has 
been set, then CI will next be incremented by two instead of by one, and the 
Test Flip Flop will be reset. Note that only the five least significant bits of 
CI are used to address a line in the store, so it is possible for a CMP 
instruction in line 30 to be followed by an instruction either in line 31 
(Accumulator positive) or in line 0 (Accumulator negative). </p>
<p>CI is incremented whether instructions are fetched automatically or manually 
(see <a href="#A332">A3.3.2</a>). 
This means that it is not possible to stop a program, perform a manual 
instruction, then resume the program where it was left. On the other hand, this 
does provide a mechanism for setting the CI before starting a program. </p>
<h3>A1.4 Function bits 13-15 in CI</h3>
<p>The SSEM was built with minimal control hardware. The fetch phase of 
instructions copies a word from the Store tube to the Control tube, putting it 
on the PI line (see <a href="#M23">section 2.3</a> 
above). This is almost the same operation as the execution phase of a JMP 
instruction, function 0, where a word is copied from the Store tube to the 
Control tube, putting it on the CI line. The same hardware is used for both 
sorts of operation, consequently, bits 13 to 15 of the CI must always be zero so 
that the decoding hardware performs the correct routing during fetch phases. 
</p>
<p>Bits 13 to 15 in the CI could become non-zero in the following ways: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Spurious bits in a JMP instruction operand line 
  <li>Spurious bits in a JRP instruction operand line, or so created by the 
  addition of the line contents to CI, 
  <li>Allowing the CI to increment such that bits carry into bit 13. This could 
  happen, for example, if a valid instruction in line 31 was followed by a valid 
  instruction in line 0. In that case there will be a carry into bit 5, and if 
  the program continues to cycle from line 31 to line 0 then eventually there 
  will be a carry into bit 13. </li></ul>
<p>The effect of non-zero bits in the function part of CI will normally be to 
cause the computer to "hang", because the decoding of the bits would not set up 
a route for the instruction from the Store into the PI. The exception is if the 
bits are 100 (function number 1), in which case the instruction from the Store 
is added to the PI left over from the previous instruction. No use is envisaged 
for this. <a name="A2">
<h2>Appendix 2 Some programming hints</h2></a>
<p></p>
<p>It is quite an art to create interesting programs with such a small storage 
capacity and tiny instruction set. However, the example programs 
<samp>HCF1</samp>, <samp>LONGDIV1</samp> and <samp>PROG1</samp> written by the 
pioneers show that much could be done with so little. Those programs suggest 
some useful techniques, and further hints are in the following sections. In 1948 
nobody had explained that it was sinful to use instructions as data and vice 
versa. </p>
<h3>A2.1 Addition in the Accumulator using the <b>SUB</b> instruction</h3>
<p>The "ADD" instruction was not provided in the original machine until August 
1948. The following fragment would be needed to add two numbers and place the 
result back in the Store. </p><pre>Line|Instr. |	Binary	     |  Comment
no. |or data|		     |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
...			
3    LDN 28   00111....010...	-x to A
4    SUB 29   10111....001...	-x - y to A  {=  -(x + y) }
5    STO 30   01111....110...	-(x + y) to Result
6    LDN 30   01111....010...	-(-(x + y)) to A   {=  (x + y)  }
7    STO 30   01111....110...	x + y to Result
...			
28   x				First number, x
29   y				Second number, y
30   x+y			Result, x + y
</pre>
<h3>A2.2 Small constants</h3>
<p>The indirect jump location used in JMP and JRP instructions can sometimes be 
used as a small constant. For example: </p><pre>Line|Instr. |	Binary	     |  Comment
no. |or data|		     |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1    LDN 30   01111....010..	First instruction in program 
2    STO 30   01111....110..	Top of loop
...			
9    SUB 20   00101....001..	Decrement Accumulator
10   CMP      00000....011...	Test Accumulator
11   JMP 20   00101....000...	Loop back to line 2 if positive, else continue
...
20   1	      10000....000	Constant with  different uses
...			
</pre>
<h3>A2.3 Indexing, or Instruction Modification</h3>
<p>A common operation is to add a small integer to a word. An example would be 
where the line number part of an instruction is to be indexed. The small integer 
should be stored as its complement as in the following fragment. </p><pre>Line|Instr. |	Binary	     |  Comment
no. |or data|		     |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
...			
6    SUB 19   11001....001...	Subtraction operation to be indexed through 
		       	           lines 19, 20, 21 etc.
...		
12   LDN  6   01100....010...	Complement of instruction to A
13   STO 0    00000....110...	Store in temporary space
14   LDN 0    00000....010...	Instruction to A
15   SUB 18   01001....001...	Modify
16   STO  6   01100....110...	Instruction indexed
17   JMP ..   .........000...	Next ...
18   -1	      111111111......	-1
...			
</pre>
<h3>A2.4 Counting</h3>
<p>Similarly, counting is a frequent program requirement. Space can be conserved 
by keeping the counter in the upper part of an instruction, as in the following 
code. </p><pre>Line|Instr. |	Binary	        |  Comment
no. |or data|		        | 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
...			
6    LDN 21  10101....010...000	  Instruction: counter in top 3 bits
....			
12   LDN  6  01100....010...	  Complement of instruction and counter to A
13   STO  0  00000....110...	  Store in temporary space
14   LDN 0   00000....010...	  Instruction and counter to A
15   SUB 20  00101....001...      Increment counter
16   STO  6  01100....110...      Counter incremented
17   CMP     00000....011...      End of count?
18   JMP ..  ...............000	  No
19   JMP ..  ...............000	  Yes
20   -1 in   00000....0000111     -1 at top of word
    top 3 bits
...			
</pre>
<h2>Appendix 3 - Physical Description</h2>
<p>A complete contemporary description of the machine is given in a paper 
published in the Proceedings of the Institution of Electrical Engineers. The 
paper was submitted in March 1950, and published as: </p>
<p>Williams F.C., Kilburn T. and Tootill G.C., "<a href="http://www.computer50.org/kgill/mark1/ssem.html">Universal High-Speed 
Digital Computers: A Small-Scale Experimental Machine</a>", Proc IEE, Vol. 98, 
Part II, No 61, February 1951, pp. 13-28. </p>
<p>A thorough, detailed understanding of that paper should be enough to enable 
anyone to write a program for the SSEM. However, there are subtleties of 
behaviour which are not made explicit. Furthermore, the exact way that the 
"input and output" controls appear to the user is not obvious. This appendix 
addresses those details where they have not already been explained earlier in 
this Programmer's Reference. There should be no contradictions between the IEE 
paper and this document, except where specifically mentioned herein. </p>
<p>This document mostly uses the terminology used in 1948, though some modern 
terminology is used where essential. For example it refers to information being 
held in a "line" where today it would probably be more usual to say "location" 
or "word". The original word "store" is used rather than the modern 
anthropomorphic word "memory".
<a name="A31">
<h3>A3.1 The Monitor</h3></a>
<p></p>
<p>There is a fourth cathode ray tube not used for storage but as a Monitor 
tube. Three interlocking push buttons allow the Monitor to be connected to any 
one of the three storage tubes. The Monitor always displays 32 lines of 32 
digits. In the case of the Store, this is a natural display of the whole 
contents of the Store. In the case of the Accumulator, which only contains one 
line of data, that line is repeated on all 32 lines of the monitor. In the case 
of the Control: while the machine is running the CI and PI appear on alternate 
lines of the Monitor, but if the machine is not running, then only the CI 
appears on all 32 lines. </p>
<p>The digits are represented on the monitor as a small dot for a zero, and a 
horizontal dash for a one. Any line of the Store is addressable for some 
operation and is known as the Action Line. On the monitor, the Action Line 
appears brightened. Manual control of the Action Line is described later in <a href="#A3321">paragraph 
A3.3.2.1</a>. </p>
<h3>A3.2 The "Stop" indicator</h3>A neon indicator lamp is situated near to the 
Monitor. It is illuminated when a Stop instruction has been decoded (see later). 

<h3>A3.3 Control Switches</h3>
<p>There are four panels containing switches. Their correct operation by the 
user is essential if the computer is to operate according to this Programmer's 
Reference. The effect of some incorrect operations, but not all, will be 
explained. </p>
<h4>A3.3.1 The Typewriter</h4>
<p>The panel contains 40 push-buttons arranged as eight columns of five buttons. 
The buttons are numbered 0 to 31 starting at top left and running down a column 
and then down succeeding columns from left to right. Only the first 32 buttons 
are connected. </p>
<p>The Typewriter is normally used while the machine is at Stop, i.e. not 
executing instructions. If the Write/Erase Switch (see below) is at "Write", 
then pushing a typewriter button causes a "one" to be written into the 
corresponding digit position of the Action Line. If the Write/Erase Switch is at 
"Erase", then a zero is written into the position. If more than one button is 
pressed simultaneously, then the result is usually but not always ineffective. 
</p>
<p>If the machine is running, then operation of the Typewriter will affect all 
the Action Lines encountered while the button is pressed. <a name="A332">
<h4>A3.3.2 The Staticisor ("Stat") Switch.</h4></a>
<p></p>
<p>There is a toggle switch labeled "Auto/Man". The switch determines the 
operation of five "Line" or "L-Stat" toggle switches, and three "Function" or 
"F-Stat" toggle switches. The machine behaves according to the setting of these 
switches as follows: <a name="A3321">
<h5>A3.3.2.1 Switch at either "Man" or "Auto", computer not running</h5></a>
<p></p>
<p>The "Line" switches select which line in the store is to be the Action Line. 
Any line-oriented operation e.g. Typewriter and KLC (see later), affects the 
Action Line. A "Line" switch is down for on, up for off. The "Function" switches 
do nothing. </p>
<h5>A3.3.2.2 Switch at "Manual", computer running</h5>
<p>The instruction represented by the setting of the "Line" and "Function" 
switches is executed repeatedly. "Single Step" mode (see later) is a special 
case of computer running where just one instruction is executed per single step. 
CI will be incremented. </p>
<h5>A3.3.2.3 Switch at "Auto", computer running</h5>
<p>Instructions are fetched from the Store and executed. The instructions 
fetched, as well as the CI itself, pass through the "Line" and "Function" 
switches on the way to the staticisor; accordingly they must all be set to "on". 
If any switch is "off", then the corresponding digit in the instruction or 
coming from CI is forced to zero, with the predictable effect. </p>
<p>If the Typewriter is operated, in conjunction with the Write/Erase Switch, 
then all lines being accessed by the running program will be appropriately 
affected. This may corrupt the program, for example if the function or line 
fields of instructions are changed. </p>
<h4>A3.3.3 Write/Erase Switch</h4>
<p>As mentioned in the description of the Typewriter, this switch determines 
whether a "one" or a "zero" is "typed" into the Store in the selected line. It 
must be in the "Write" position while the computer is running. Should it be left 
in the "Erase" position, then all action lines would be corrupted. </p>
<h4>A3.3.4 Storage clearing keys</h4>
<p>There is a set of key switches each of which clears the appropriate storage 
locations to zeroes. Their use while the computer is running is unpredictable. 
They are non-locking, i.e. return to the neutral position when released. </p>
<h5>A3.3.4.1 Key Line Clear (KLC)</h5>
<p>Clears the Action Line. If this key is operated while a program is running, 
then all lines being accessed by the program will be cleared, thereby corrupting 
the program. </p>
<h5>A3.3.4.2 Key Store Clear (KSC)</h5>
<p>Clears the whole Store. Obliterates any existing program, whether the 
computer is running or not. </p>
<h5>A3.3.4.3 Key Control Clear (KCC)</h5>
<p>Despite its name this key clears both the Control tube and the Accumulator 
tube. If the key is operated while a program is running, then the result is not 
predictable, and in some circumstances the program will be corrupted. </p>
<h5>A3.3.4.4 KAC, KBC, KEC, KMC</h5>
<p>Although physically present, these switches are not connected. </p>
<h4>A3.3.5 Monitor selector</h4>
<p>These interlocking push buttons enable the Monitor tube to be connected to 
the output of one of the three Storage tubes (see <a href="#A31">A3.1 above</a>.) </p>
<h4>A3.3.6 CS switch</h4>
<p>The Completion Signal (or Prepulse) toggle switch, CS, has an up position 
marked "Stop" and a down position marked "Run". ( The term "Completion Signal" 
is a hangover from the early days when the designers thought of the pulse which 
initiates a new instruction as actually completing the previous instruction. In 
June 1948 they were in transition to calling it the "Prepulse"). </p>
<p>In the "Stop" position, prepulses are inhibited, so the machine does not run 
and execute instructions automatically. In the "Run" position, prepulses are 
generated automatically at the end of each instruction, so causing the next 
instruction to be fetched and executed. Prepulses are inhibited if a Stop 
instruction has been encountered and the "Stop" neon is illuminated. </p>
<h4>A3.3.7 Key Completion, (KC) also known as Key Single Prepulse (KSP)</h4>
<p>This is effectively the non-locking Single Step key. It is effective when the 
CS switch is at Stop, and causes one prepulse to be generated. Thus one 
instruction will be fetched and executed. If such instruction is not a Stop 
instruction, then incidentally the "Stop" neon, if illuminated, will be 
extinguished. </p>
