# Manchester Baby Simulator - Windows Installation

## Quick Start

1. Download `baby-windows.zip` from the latest release
2. Extract the zip file to a location of your choice
3. Double-click `baby.exe` to run the simulator

The executable includes its own Java Runtime Environment (JRE), so you don't need to install Java separately.

## System Requirements

- Windows 64-bit operating system on x64 architecture
- At least 512MB of RAM
- Screen resolution of 1024x768 or higher

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure you extracted all files from the zip archive
2. Verify that the `jre` directory is in the same location as the executable
3. Verify that the `baby.jar` file is in the same location as the executable
4. Check that your antivirus is not blocking the application
5. Try running the executable as administrator
