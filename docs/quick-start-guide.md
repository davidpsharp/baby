Visit [manchesterbaby.com](https://manchesterbaby.com) and wait a few seconds for it to load.

1. Select an example program from the menu to be loaded.
2. Click on **KC** or press F10 on your keyboard to repeatedly step through one instruction at a time.
3. Flick the **Stop / Run** switch or press F5 on your keyboard to run the program until the Stop lamp comes on.

Congratulations, you just learned how to run programs on the world's first stored-program computer from 1948!

## What can it do

Despite only have 32 lines each of 32 bits (for 128 bytes of total memory), all visible on it's Cathode Ray Tube monitor. The Manchester Small Scale Experimental Machine or 'Baby' as it was nicknamed could run some impressive programs including animations.

## Real-life replica

In the run up to the 50th anniversary of the original machine, a team at Manchester rebuilt a replica of the original which is now on display and operational at the [Science and Industry Museum, Manchester](https://www.scienceandindustrymuseum.org.uk/whats-on/meet-baby), England. The team of volunteers at the museum uses this simulator to practice operating the real machine and you can learn how to as well.

## How to program the Baby

The machine only has 6 instructions and you can either program it very slowly, exactly as the original machine was, using the typewriter buttons and switches on the control panel.

Alternatively you can write a program to run on the simulator in modern-style assembly language in any text editor and these programs can also be run on the real replica! Source code for the example programs included with the simulator is available [here](https://github.com/davidpsharp/baby/tree/main/src/main/resources/demos).

See the [Introduction to Programming the Baby Computer](intro-to-programming-the-baby.md) for details.

## Running the simulator as an application

The simulator is written in Java meaning it can be run on any computer or architecture; Windows, Mac or Linux, including Raspberry Pi and doesn't require a web browser or Internet access.

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/davidpsharp/baby/releases) to run offline on your computer. You may need to install a Java Runtime if you don't already have one installed, version 8 or later is required.

Full [source code](https://github.com/davidpsharp/baby) for the simulator is available on github and contributions are welcome.
